# Requirements: JobFlow

**Defined:** 2026-02-07
**Core Value:** From discovery to application in one tool -- reliably find relevant jobs, present them clearly, make applying frictionless.

## v1 Requirements

Requirements for initial release. Each maps to roadmap phases.

### Configuration

- [x] **CFG-01**: User configures all settings via single YAML file (profile, queries, scoring weights, timing, platform toggles)
- [x] **CFG-02**: Pipeline runs on a schedule (cron/systemd/launchd) without manual CLI invocation
- [x] **CFG-03**: All salary data normalized to comparable USD annual figures across platforms
- [x] **CFG-04**: User selects apply mode per job or globally: full-auto (with approval gate), semi-auto (review before submit), Easy Apply only

### Discovery & Scoring

- [x] **DISC-01**: Pipeline detects and highlights new jobs not seen in previous runs
- [x] **DISC-02**: Fuzzy deduplication catches company name variants ("Google" vs "Google LLC" vs "Alphabet")
- [x] **DISC-03**: Score breakdown shows point-by-point explanation (title +2, tech overlap +2, remote +1, salary +1)

### Dashboard

- [x] **DASH-01**: Text search across job title, company, and description
- [x] **DASH-02**: Extended status workflow: Saved, Applied, Phone Screen, Technical Interview, Final Interview, Offer, Rejected, Withdrawn, Ghosted
- [x] **DASH-03**: Bulk status actions -- select multiple jobs, update status in one click
- [x] **DASH-04**: Export filtered results to CSV or JSON from dashboard
- [x] **DASH-05**: Activity log per job -- timeline of discovery, status changes, notes, applications
- [x] **DASH-06**: Enhanced stats -- jobs per day/week, response rate, time-in-stage, platform effectiveness
- [x] **DASH-07**: Kanban board view with drag-and-drop between status columns

### AI & Resume

- [x] **AI-01**: AI-generated tailored resume per job description using LLM (reorder skills, adjust summary, emphasize relevant experience)
- [x] **AI-02**: AI-generated targeted cover letter per application
- [x] **AI-03**: Multi-resume management -- store versions, track which resume sent to which company

### Application

- [x] **APPLY-01**: One-click apply from dashboard -- triggers browser automation from web UI with status updates

### Platform

- [x] **PLAT-01**: Pluggable platform architecture -- add new job boards without modifying core pipeline code
