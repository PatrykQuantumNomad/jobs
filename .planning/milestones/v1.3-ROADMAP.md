# Milestone v1.3: Project Showcase Site

**Status:** SHIPPED 2026-02-13
**Phases:** 20-24
**Total Plans:** 10

## Overview

Professional GitHub Pages showcase site for JobFlow, built with Astro v5 and Tailwind v4. Marketing-forward single-page design with 9 content sections, animated terminal demo, dark mode, scroll animations, and automated deployment via GitHub Actions. Communicates engineering depth to recruiters and hiring managers in under 30 seconds.

## Phases

### Phase 20: Foundation and Configuration

**Goal:** A working Astro project exists in `/site` with correct base path, professional design tokens, self-hosted fonts, and a BaseLayout that produces valid social sharing previews.
**Depends on:** None (first phase of milestone)
**Plans:** 1 plan

Plans:
- [x] 20-01: Scaffold Astro project with Tailwind v4, design tokens, BaseLayout with SEO meta tags, and minimal index page

**Details:**
- Astro v5 with `base: "/jobs"` and `trailingSlash: "always"` for GitHub Pages
- Tailwind v4 via `@tailwindcss/vite` with CSS-first `@theme` design tokens (OKLCH)
- 11-shade primary blues + 11-shade surface grays palette
- Self-hosted Inter Variable (body) + DM Sans Variable (display) via @fontsource
- BaseLayout with OpenGraph and Twitter Card meta tags using absolute URLs
- ClientRouter (Astro 5 view transitions)

**Depends on:** Phase 20
**Plans:** 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 21-01: ScreenshotFrame component, SVG icon library, Hero section, and Stats bar
- [x] 21-02: Features grid, TechStack badges, Footer, and full page composition with responsive verification

**Details:**
- ScreenshotFrame browser mockup with traffic light dots and gradient placeholder
- 12 SVG icons (Feather/Lucide style with currentColor)
- Hero with "Job Search, Automated" headline, GitHub CTA, and ScreenshotFrame

### Phase 22: Engineering Depth Sections

**Goal:** Architecture details, real code examples, project history, and quick start guide demonstrating engineering depth.
**Depends on:** Phase 21
**Plans:** 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 22-01: Architecture pipeline diagram and Code Snippets with Shiki syntax highlighting
- [x] 22-02: Timeline, QuickStart, and full page composition with all 9 sections

**Details:**
- Architecture section: 5-phase pipeline visualization (Setup, Login, Search, Score, Apply)
- CodeSnippets: 3 curated Python excerpts with github-dark-default Shiki theme
- Timeline: v1.0/v1.1/v1.2 milestones with stats per version
- QuickStart: 5-step setup guide with Shiki-highlighted bash blocks

### Phase 23: CI/CD, Deployment, and Dark Mode

**Goal:** Site deployed to GitHub Pages, Python CI not disrupted, dark mode support.
**Depends on:** Phase 22
**Plans:** 3 plans

Plans:
- [x] 23-01: GitHub Actions deploy workflow, CI path isolation, sitemap integration, and JSON-LD structured data
- [x] 23-02: Dark mode infrastructure and dark: utility classes on all section components
- [x] 23-03: Deployment verification: enable Pages, push, and verify production site

**Details:**
- deploy-site.yml with withastro/action@v5 and path-based triggers (site/**)
- Python CI paths-ignore: ['site/**'] for workflow isolation
- @astrojs/sitemap producing sitemap-index.xml
- JSON-LD SoftwareApplication schema in BaseLayout
- @custom-variant dark directive with data-theme attribute

- [x] 24-02: Scroll-triggered fade-in animations via IntersectionObserver + CSS transitions

**Details:**
- Sticky NavBar with "JobFlow" logo, 5 anchor links, ThemeToggle integrated
- Smooth scroll with scroll-margin-top for fixed nav offset
- TerminalDemo: character-by-character command typing + line-by-line output reveal
- IntersectionObserver fires animation once and unobserves
- Scroll-triggered fade-in on 6 below-fold sections
- .js-enabled CSS gate for progressive enhancement
- prefers-reduced-motion disables all animations

## Milestone Summary

**Decimal Phases:** None

**Key Decisions:**
- Astro for site (not Starlight) -- marketing-forward, not docs-heavy
- Same-repo /site folder -- one repo, GitHub Pages from subfolder
- Blues/grays professional palette -- distinct from personal site (orange) and networking-tools (dark orange)
- Tailwind v4 via @tailwindcss/vite (not deprecated @astrojs/tailwind)
- CSS-first @theme tokens with OKLCH values (no tailwind.config.js)
- data-theme attribute (not .dark class) for Tailwind v4 @custom-variant
- Path-based workflow isolation: site/** triggers deploy, Python CI ignores site/**
- Custom IntersectionObserver typing animation (not typed.js)
- .js-enabled CSS gate for progressive enhancement (content visible without JS)

**Issues Resolved:**
- Astro scaffolder CLI interactive prompt -- resolved with --no-git flag
- @astrojs/check required installing @astrojs/check + typescript dev dependencies
- Tailwind v4 vite plugin type mismatch with Astro's bundled vite types (upstream issue, doesn't affect builds)
- Site URL initially had wrong GitHub username -- fixed in 23-03 deployment verification

**Issues Deferred:**
- ScreenshotFrame.astro unused (replaced by TerminalDemo in Hero) -- kept for future screenshot embedding
- Real dashboard screenshots (requires running app) -- deferred to v1.4+

**Technical Debt Incurred:**
- ScreenshotFrame.astro intentionally kept but unused
- Phase 23 VERIFICATION.md shows stale gaps_found status (URLs were fixed in 23-03)
