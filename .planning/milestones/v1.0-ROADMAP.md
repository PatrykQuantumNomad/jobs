# Milestone v1.0: MVP

**Status:** SHIPPED 2026-02-08
**Phases:** 1-8
**Total Plans:** 24

## Overview

JobFlow v1.0 transforms a CLI job search tool into a daily-driver automation platform: externalized configuration, pluggable platform architecture, smarter discovery with delta detection and fuzzy dedup, a polished dashboard with search/kanban/analytics, AI-powered resume tailoring per application, and a capstone one-click apply flow triggered from the web UI.

## Phases

### Phase 1: Config Externalization
**Goal**: User configures their entire profile, search queries, scoring weights, timing, and platform toggles in a single YAML file instead of editing Python source code
**Depends on**: Nothing (first phase)
**Requirements**: CFG-01
**Plans:** 3 plans

Plans:
- [x] 01-01-PLAN.md -- AppSettings model, YAML loader, config files, and dependency setup
- [x] 01-02-PLAN.md -- Pipeline consumer migration (orchestrator, scorer, form_filler) and --validate flag
- [x] 01-03-PLAN.md -- Platform module migration (base, indeed, dice, remoteok)

### Phase 2: Platform Architecture
**Goal**: Adding a new job board requires creating one file that implements a protocol -- no changes to the orchestrator, config, or scoring pipeline
**Depends on**: Phase 1
**Requirements**: PLAT-01
**Plans:** 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 02-01-PLAN.md -- Protocol definitions (BrowserPlatform, APIPlatform), registry decorator with fail-fast validation, and BrowserPlatformMixin
- [x] 02-02-PLAN.md -- Big-bang migration: all three adapters to protocols, orchestrator to registry-based iteration, auto-discovery in __init__.py, BasePlatform ABC deleted

### Phase 3: Discovery Engine
**Goal**: The scrape-and-score loop produces smarter, more transparent results -- fuzzy company matching catches duplicates the current exact-match misses, score breakdowns explain why each job scored what it did, salary data is comparable across platforms, and repeat runs highlight what is new
**Depends on**: Phase 1
**Requirements**: DISC-01, DISC-02, DISC-03, CFG-03
**Plans:** 3 plans

Plans:
- [x] 03-01-PLAN.md -- New processing modules (salary.py, dedup.py), scorer breakdown refactor, model updates
- [x] 03-02-PLAN.md -- DB schema migration (versioned), orchestrator wiring for salary/dedup/breakdown/delta
- [x] 03-03-PLAN.md -- Dashboard UI: NEW badges, inline score breakdown, salary display, company aliases

### Phase 4: Scheduled Automation
**Goal**: The pipeline runs automatically on a schedule without manual CLI invocation, producing fresh results daily
**Depends on**: Phase 1, Phase 3
**Requirements**: CFG-02
**Plans:** 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 04-01-PLAN.md -- ScheduleConfig model, --scheduled flag, input() guards, scheduler.py CLI (launchd plist management)
- [x] 04-02-PLAN.md -- run_history table, pipeline run recording, /runs dashboard page

### Phase 5: Dashboard Core
**Goal**: The web dashboard becomes the primary interface for managing the job search -- users can find specific jobs, track them through an application pipeline, take bulk actions, export data, and see a full activity timeline per job
**Depends on**: Phase 1, Phase 3
**Requirements**: DASH-01, DASH-02, DASH-03, DASH-04, DASH-05
**Plans:** 4 plans

Plans:
- [x] 05-01-PLAN.md -- Schema migration (FTS5, activity_log, status vocabulary), JobStatus enum expansion, CSS classes
- [x] 05-02-PLAN.md -- Text search with FTS5 backend, htmx active search, partial template extraction
- [x] 05-03-PLAN.md -- Activity timeline on job detail page, status dropdown with 9 user-facing statuses
- [x] 05-04-PLAN.md -- Bulk status actions (checkboxes, select-all, bulk bar), CSV/JSON export

### Phase 6: Dashboard Analytics
**Goal**: Users can visualize their job search progress with metrics and manage their pipeline through an intuitive kanban board
**Depends on**: Phase 5
**Requirements**: DASH-06, DASH-07
**Plans:** 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 06-01-PLAN.md -- Analytics engine (SQLite queries, Chart.js charts, /analytics page, /api/analytics JSON endpoint)
- [x] 06-02-PLAN.md -- Kanban board view with SortableJS drag-and-drop, HX-Trigger stats sync

### Phase 7: AI Resume & Cover Letter
**Goal**: Users generate a tailored resume and cover letter for each application, with AI reordering real experience to match the job description -- never fabricating new claims
**Depends on**: Phase 1
**Requirements**: AI-01, AI-02, AI-03
**Plans:** 4 plans

Plans:
- [x] 07-01-PLAN.md -- Dependencies, Pydantic models, PDF extractor, resume version tracker + DB migration
- [x] 07-02-PLAN.md -- Resume tailoring and cover letter generation with Anthropic structured outputs
- [x] 07-03-PLAN.md -- PDF renderer (WeasyPrint + Jinja2 templates) and diff generator (difflib)
- [x] 07-04-PLAN.md -- Dashboard integration (tailor/generate buttons, diff view, version history, PDF download)

### Phase 8: One-Click Apply
**Goal**: Users can apply to jobs directly from the dashboard with configurable automation levels -- from fully automated (with approval gate) to manual URL opening
**Depends on**: Phase 2, Phase 5, Phase 7
**Requirements**: CFG-04, APPLY-01
**Plans:** 4 plans

Plans:
- [x] 08-01-PLAN.md -- Apply config models (ApplyMode, ApplyConfig, ApplyEvent), duplicate detection, config.yaml integration
- [x] 08-02-PLAN.md -- Apply engine with thread bridge, event emission, enhanced form filler, event-based confirmation
- [x] 08-03-PLAN.md -- Dashboard SSE integration (sse-starlette, htmx SSE extension, apply endpoints, UI)
- [x] 08-04-PLAN.md -- Smoke tests and human verification of full apply flow

## Milestone Summary

**Key Decisions:**
- pydantic-settings with YAML for configuration (clean, validated, type-safe)
- Protocol-based platform architecture instead of ABC inheritance (more Pythonic, easier to test)
- Anthropic SDK for AI resume/cover letter (lightweight, no LangChain overhead)
- asyncio.to_thread for Playwright-to-FastAPI thread bridging with loop.call_soon_threadsafe for SSE
- Semaphore(1) for single-apply serialization
- FTS5 content-sync tables for search without double-storage
- WeasyPrint for PDF rendering with Calibri/Carlito fallback for ATS compatibility
- Temperature=0 for resume tailoring (max accuracy), 0.3 for cover letters (natural writing)

**Issues Resolved:**
- playwright-stealth 2.0.1 API migration (old stealth_sync removed)
- Indeed bogus data-jk values (~50% invalid) handled via 404 detection
- Dice DOM migration from dhi-search-card to data-testid selectors
- Circular import prevention via lazy imports throughout

**Issues Deferred:**
- No formal test suite (unit/integration tests deferred to future milestone)
- ATS form fill covers 5 providers but needs broader coverage
- No notification system for scheduled run results

**Technical Debt Incurred:**
- Some lazy imports could be replaced with proper dependency injection
- No automated tests -- manual verification only
- Dashboard uses CDN-loaded JS libraries (htmx, Chart.js, SortableJS) rather than bundled
