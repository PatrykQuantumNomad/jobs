## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: 8-phase structure derived from 19 requirements at comprehensive depth
- [Roadmap]: pydantic-settings with YAML for config (research recommendation)
- [Roadmap]: Protocol-based platform architecture instead of ABC inheritance
- [Roadmap]: anthropic SDK for AI resume/cover letter (not LangChain -- too heavy for single-prompt use)
- [Roadmap]: One-click apply is capstone (Phase 8) -- requires dashboard, AI, and platform architecture ready

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Research]: ATS form diversity (Greenhouse, Lever, Workday, Ashby) needs phase-level research before Phase 8 planning
- [Research]: Behavioral fingerprinting guardrails need careful implementation in Phase 8 apply engine
